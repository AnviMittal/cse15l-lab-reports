danah boyd is one of the principle researchers on social media.


She says that 
> Today's teens are growing up in a world where social media is everywhere. Regardless of whether or not they have access to these technologies or how they engage with them, there is little doubt that social media is playing a significant role in the changing landscape of American youth.

However she states several reasons to support that social media should stay relevant
* Profiles. Social network site profiles are where youth write themselves into being.
* Friends. Social network site Friends are not the same as your closest and dearest.
* Comments. Most adults look at the comments on teens' profiles or Wall and get all uppity.
* New Feed. 

She also explains the negative aspects of social media
1. Persistence. What you say sticks around. 
2. Replicability. You can copy and paste a conversation from one medium to another, adding to the persistent nature of it.
3. Searchability. My mother would've loved to scream search into the air and figure out where I'd run off with friends. She couldn't; I'm quite thankful. But with social media, it's quite easy to track someone down or to find someone as a result of searching for content.
4. Scalability. Social media scales things in new ways.
